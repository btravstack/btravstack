- c118a74: Raise the published Node floor to `>=22`, and use `Promise.withResolvers`.

  Node 20 reached end of life on **2026-04-30**. Every line that still receives
  security fixes — 22, 24, 26 — satisfies `>=22`, so this drops a promise rather
  than a supported runtime.

  **The old floor was never provable.** CI runs the dev toolchain, and pnpm 11
  needs `node:sqlite`, which Node 20 does not have — so no job here could ever
  execute the line `>=20` named, and `ci.yml` said so in a comment. The new floor
  sits on the same major as the matrix's `22.22` row, so the promise is exercised.

  The knock-on is `@btravstack/core`'s: `createDeferred` was an eight-line shim
  for a primitive the platform ships as `Promise.withResolvers`, held back only
  by the floor. It is gone, along with `src/deferred.ts`. `Deferred` was never
  exported, so no public surface moves — the only visible change is the
  `engines` field.

  `packages/core` raises its `lib` to `ES2024` for this, alone in the repository
  and commented where it happens; the shared `@btravstack/tsconfig` base stays on
  `ES2023` until a second package needs otherwise.

- 6f964fa: A module declares what its own providers expect from outside

  `Module(name)({ … })` takes a fourth list, `needs`. A port **this module's own
  providers** read, and that nothing here satisfies, must be named there; anything
  they owe and it does not name is refused at that call, with the port in the
  message:

  ```
  Property '"UNDECLARED NEEDS — name it in `needs`"' is missing in type
    '{ provides: [...]; exports: [...]; }' but required in type
    '{ readonly "UNDECLARED NEEDS — name it in `needs`": Logger; }'.
  ```

  Before this, a need nothing local satisfied simply travelled to whoever
  composed the module, and a composition root could satisfy an imported module's
  dependency without that module ever mentioning it — measured: a slice's
  provider received the root's service while importing nothing at all. A slice
  directory could not be read on its own.

  `needs` is the explicit stand-in for NestJS's `@Global`, which this container
  does not have and now does not need: the port is named, the supplier is not, so
  the slice still composes into any root that answers it.

  **An import's own needs are not the importer's to re-declare.** They are already
  published in the import's type, and the entry point still refuses a root that
  has not discharged them — so the declaration lands on the feature that reads the
  port, once, rather than on every module between it and the root. That is
  `ConfigModule.forFeature`'s shape reached without a global: `DatabaseModule`
  says `needs: [Env]` because it reads `DATABASE_URL`, and the persistence modules
  and slices that import it say nothing.

  `Scope` is exempt — nothing can provide it, and the entry point discharges it.

  The three starter sugars — `HttpModule`, `AmqpModule`, `TemporalModule` — take
  `needs` too and re-declare the gate over their augmented tuples, so a
  composition root written with a sugar is checked exactly like a bare
  `Module(name)`.

  `@btravstack/di` additionally exports `NeedsGate` and `Unmet`, which a package
  offering its own shaped module needs in order to re-declare the gate.

- b8fdee9: The `Unmet` type is gone from `@btravstack/di`

  Its documented purpose — a shaped module re-declaring the gates with it — was
  impossible to serve: declaration emit keeps the alias unreduced, and the
  unreduced form names imported modules' internal ports (TS2883 on the first
  consumer that exports a composition root), which is why every in-repo sugar
  already inlined the computation instead. Inline it; `NeedsGate` is unchanged
  and still exported.

  Internal trims alongside, none of them surface: `@btravstack/http-server` no longer
  memoises scheme ports (di resolves by id, so a fresh class per call is the same
  lookup — measured), and `HasMark`, `authenticatorPort` and `Http.authenticators`
  now carry TSDoc naming the external consumer each exists for, so their lack of
  an in-repo caller stops reading as dead surface.

- d5be140: `Runtime.needs` is `Runtime.resolves`

  Two different `needs` in one framework was one too many. di's `Module` has a
  `needs` — what a composition root supplies it — and the kernel's `Runtime` had
  one too, meaning something else entirely: the ports the runtime reads back out
  of the built application context. They never appear in the same object, which
  is exactly why the collision was easy to miss and easy to misread.

  ```ts
  const runtime: Runtime<typeof Clock> = {
    name: "ticker",
    resolves: [Clock],
    start: (host) => OkAsync(serving),
  };
  ```

  The type parameter is `Resolves` rather than `Needs` throughout —
  `Runtime<Resolves, Info>`, `RuntimeHost<Resolves>`, `RunUnit<Resolves>` — and
  `start`'s gate sentence follows:
  `"UNSATISFIED RUNTIME PORTS — the runtime resolves a port the module does not export"`.

  Every shipped runtime declares `resolves: []`, so an application that composes
  `http()` / `temporal()` / `amqp()` and never writes a runtime by hand is
  unaffected. A **hand-rolled** runtime renames one field.

  The array is still never read at run time — it exists so `Resolves` is
  inferable from the value, and `start`'s gate checks it against the module's
  exports.

- 3bf4036: A contract may name a scope only if its scheme can grant it

  `HttpRouter(contract)` now refuses a contract declaring a scope outside the
  vocabulary its scheme's authenticator was minted with, and the diagnostic ends
  on the offending scope:

  ```
  Property '"UNGRANTABLE SCOPE — its scheme's authenticator cannot grant it"' is
    missing in type 'Authenticated<…, [{ user: ["order:export"] }]>' but required
    in type '{ readonly "UNGRANTABLE SCOPE — …": "order:export"; }'
  ```

  Before this, nothing tied a contract's scope **strings** to what a scheme could
  actually grant. A typo — or a scope asked of a scheme declared with no
  vocabulary at all — compiled, passed every check, and then refused every caller
  on that route with a permanent `403` and no diagnostic anywhere.

  A requirement naming no scopes costs nothing, which is the common case. The
  check is the sibling of the scheme-**name** check di already performs by leaving
  an unknown scheme's port unmet.

### Patch Changes

- 4499df1: A comment earns its line, or it goes

  A quarter of the TypeScript in this repository was comment, and one line in ten
  an inline essay — so a reader looking for the code had to skim past the reasons
  for it. `CLAUDE.md`'s "comment density: sparse" bullet now carries a test: a
  comment earns its line only if it guards a specific line against a plausible
  "simplification", states a symbol's contract as TSDoc, is a directive with a
  reason, or is a `GIVEN`/`WHEN`/`THEN` marker.

  No API changes. What consumers see is the TSDoc these packages ship in their
  declarations: shorter, and stating each symbol's contract rather than the
  history behind it, which lives in the repository and on the documentation site.

- fc38b9a: The README samples compile again — and now cannot stop. Every `ts` fence in
  the package READMEs, the root README and the documentation site is extracted
  into generated type-test modules and compiled by `pnpm typecheck`. The sweep
  that built the gate fixed the drift it found: the amqp and temporal READMEs'
  two-argument `execute` from before the branded tenant, a wrong consumer key,
  a missing error-triage arm, and the pre-`defineHttp` router spelling in the
  root README.
- 31f70f7: The repository is `btravstack/btravstack`, so every package's `homepage`,
  `bugs.url` and `repository.url` points there. GitHub redirects the old slug, so
  nothing was broken — but published metadata that names a repository should name
  the one it lives in.

### Minor Changes

- f133934: **Configuration, the twelve-factor way, in its own package.** `@btravstack/config`
  exports `Env` — the environment as a port, which `@btravstack/core` provides to
  every graph `start` boots (`process.env`, or `StartOptions.env` for a test) —
  and `Config`:
  `Config.string/integer/port(variable, { default?, min?, max? })` fields,
  `Config.object({...})` composing them into a Standard Schema over the
  environment (any other Standard Schema, a `zod` object over the raw variables
  for instance, is accepted too), and `Config.provider(Port)(schema)` binding a
  port from `Env` — a modeled `ConfigInvalid` naming every offending variable
  when the environment is wrong, which `runMain` maps to sysexits(3)'s
  `EX_CONFIG` (78) rather than the generic startup `1`. The kernel binds its own
  `PROBE_PORT` the same way (default `9000`; `probes` still overrides), and a
  startup failure of any kind is now reported as a `startFailed` kernel event
  before `stopping`, so a bad environment is named on stderr instead of exiting
  silently. An empty or blank variable is an error, never an absent one; `PORT=0`
  stays expressible.

  `@btravstack/http-server` becomes a starter: `http()` provides
  `HttpRuntime` and `HttpConfig`, bound from `PORT` (default `3000`) and `HOST`
  (default `0.0.0.0`) unless pinned (`http({ port: 0 })` for a test —
  explicit beats environment beats default, per field, through
  `Config.pinned(value, field)`; a pinned field reads nothing from the
  environment, and the module's declared `Env` need and `ConfigInvalid` stay
  whatever is pinned). `RuntimeNeedsGate` is renamed `StartGate`, since it now
  also states `NO RUNTIME`.

  `Config.provider("Name")(schema)` — the name form — mints the port (its
  service is the schema's output) and returns the provider carrying it typed
  (`provider.port`), the shape for a slice that is one application's own; the
  class form `Config.provider(Port)(schema)` stays for a slice that is public
  API another package names. Config is the one sugar that takes a name — several
  config slices per application is normal, and the name is what `ConfigInvalid`
  prints; the starters' `HttpRouter` / `TemporalActivities` / `AmqpHandlers`
  provide the starter's own fixed port and take none.
