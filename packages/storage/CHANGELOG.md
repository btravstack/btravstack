### Minor Changes

- 525ab53: htmx fragments: a second `HttpHandler` answerer, serving `Html` escaped by default.

  `html`/`raw` (`Html`, an object rather than a bare string) escape every
  interpolation by default; `raw(markup)` is the one way past the escaping, a
  visible act at the call site. The escaping is context-blind: it protects
  element text and a quoted attribute value, and nothing else — an unquoted
  attribute, an attribute name, a URL scheme and `<script>`/`<style>` contents
  are the caller's own responsibility.

  `api.HtmxGet(path, options?)` and `api.HtmxPost(path, options?)` mint a route
  straight from its path — no contract in between. `options.requires`, typed
  exactly as an oRPC procedure's `authenticated()` mark, gives a route the same
  principal and the same 401/403 path as a procedure. It is **not** an oRPC
  contract: a browser navigation is not an RPC call, so a route answers `Html`
  rather than a typed envelope, and its errors are the slice's own to recover
  into a rendered fragment rather than a declared union a client branches on.
  `HtmxPost` additionally takes `options.input`, the Standard Schema that
  validates the decoded form body. `ParamsOf<Path>` extracts a path template's
  `:name` segments at the type level.

  `api.HtmxFragments([piece, …])` composes an array of `HtmxGet`/`HtmxPost`
  pieces into one port, keyed by index. `htmx({ prefix? })` is the answerer, a
  second `HttpHandler` member alongside `orpc()`.

  `HttpModule({ router?, fragments?, fragmentsPrefix?, … })` composes a router,
  fragments, or both — supplying neither is refused at the call against a
  "SERVES NOTHING" gate. A scheme shared between the two is deduplicated by
  reference before it reaches `provides`; `HttpModuleOptions`'s leading generic
  parameters go from three (`RouterError, RouterNeeds, Auth`, when `router` was
  required) to two (`Router, Fragments`, both optional) for this.

  Limitations ship stated rather than discovered: the POST body decodes through
  `Object.fromEntries`, assumed `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with no
  `content-type` check, so a `<select multiple>` or a checkbox group keeps only
  the last value and a JSON body reads as one garbage key; route order is the
  composition root's — an unmarked route declared before a marked route whose
  path can also match the same request answers it, with no authentication run;
  a route always answers `200` on success, so `HX-Redirect`, `HX-Trigger`,
  `HX-Retarget` and `HX-Reswap` are unreachable and a route cannot answer its
  own `404` or `422`; and every `200` carries `Cache-Control: no-store`,
  unconditional, since the package has no way to know a route's output is safe
  for a shared cache to keep.

- a38697e: The authentication walk and the socket half are reusable by a second answerer.

  `resolvePrincipal(requirements, authenticators, headers)` is the walk oRPC's
  `principalMiddleware` used to hold — requirements in declared order, the scope
  comparison, the grant brand test — answering an `AsyncResult` instead of
  calling oRPC's `next()`. `principalMiddleware` is now the oRPC adapter over it.
  A second protocol therefore shares one scope check rather than copying it.

  `httpServer(options)` is the socket, runtime and configuration with **no**
  answerer; `http(options)` is `httpServer(options)` plus `orpc(options)` and is
  unchanged in both behaviour and signature. This is what makes a graph serving
  only fragments expressible: it would otherwise have had to compose `http()`
  and declare an oRPC router it does not have.

  `UnderScoped` is exported: the `403` case, distinct from `Unauthenticated`'s
  `401`. It was already tracked inside the walk and collapsed at the end.

- 06ba8c7: `HttpHandler` is a set port, so HTTP can carry more than one protocol.

  It was a single function, and its own TSDoc said why: "there is one way to
  answer HTTP here, oRPC, so nothing outside this package provides or names it."
  That was true of the package and is no longer the intent — GraphQL and htmx
  fragments are coming, and neither is an oRPC procedure.

  ```ts
  type HttpAnswerer = {
    readonly prefix: `/${string}`;
    readonly handle: (request, response, signal) => PromiseLike<unknown>;
  };
  ```

  Every protocol served in the process contributes one member, and the runtime
  routes each request to the one whose prefix matches **longest**. `/rpc` owns
  `/rpc` and everything under it; a `/` fragment answerer takes the rest.

  ## Why routing rather than a chain

  A graph holds exactly one runtime (thesis #1), so several protocols cannot be
  several runtimes — they are several answerers under one. The open question was
  how a request finds its answerer. A chain of "answer or decline" would have
  made ordering a property of provider registration across modules, visible in no
  single line, and would have needed the matched signal the port deliberately
  discards. Longest-prefix routing needs neither: nesting is the expected shape,
  so there is nothing to order.

  - A mount point is a **path segment**, not a string prefix — `/rpc` does not
    own `/rpcx`.
  - A trailing slash is the same mount, so `/rpc` and `/rpc/` collide, and two
    answerers on one mount is a `RuntimeStartFailed` at `listen` rather than a
    coin toss.
  - A path no mount covers is the runtime's own `404`, written before any
    answerer is consulted. A path a mount does cover, whose answerer declines, is
    the same `404` it always was — oRPC's behaviour is unchanged.

  ## What a composition root has to change

  **`HttpRuntime` now resolves `HttpHandler`**, because a member contributed by a
  sibling module is not visible from inside the starter's own — `resolves` is the
  kernel's existing mechanism for what a runtime reads out of the application
  context. So the root must export it:

  ```ts
  Module("OrderApi")({ imports: [http()], exports: [HttpRuntime, HttpHandler] });
  ```

  `HttpModule` adds it for you, and `start`'s `UNSATISFIED RUNTIME PORTS` names
  the port when a hand-written root forgets — that arm had no shipped starter
  declaring anything until now.

  `HttpHandler` is exported from the package for the first time, since a second
  protocol's package has to name it.

  ## An answerer outside a contract is public

  `@btravstack/contract`'s marker is what says which scheme protects an oRPC
  procedure. A GraphQL operation or an HTML fragment has no such statement, so
  its routes are public unless the answerer brings authentication of its own —
  exactly as an unmarked procedure is public, and with the same absence of a gate
  for "you forgot". What the common way across protocols should be is #179's
  question, and is deliberately not answered here.

- e749953: `HttpController` and `HttpRouter` are renamed `OrpcController` and `OrpcRouter`.

  A name is qualified by the half it implements — the rule that made the package
  `http-server` rather than `http`, applied one level down. `HttpHandler` became a
  set port carrying several protocols, and the oRPC pieces were the only ones
  still claiming the umbrella: the answerer factories were already `orpc()` and
  `htmx()`, and the htmx pieces were already `HtmxGet`/`HtmxPost`/`HtmxFragments`,
  while the oRPC pieces read as the transport's own. `HttpRouterPort` held an
  oRPC `Router` — the HTTP router is `HttpHandler`, which routes each request to
  the answerer whose prefix matches longest.

  The line the rename draws: `Http*` is the **transport** — `HttpRuntime`,
  `HttpModule`, `HttpConfig`, `HttpHandler`, `defineHttp`, `http()`, all
  unchanged — and a protocol prefix is **one answerer's pieces**,
  `OrpcController`/`OrpcRouter` beside `HtmxGet`/`HtmxPost`/`HtmxFragments`, and
  whatever GraphQL brings next.

  Migration is two identifiers, including the di port id `"HttpRouter"` and the
  controller port-id prefix `"HttpController:"`, which become `"OrpcRouter"` and
  `"OrpcController:"`:

  ```text
  api.HttpController(contract, path)  →  api.OrpcController(contract, path)
  api.HttpRouter(contract)([…])       →  api.OrpcRouter(contract)([…])
  HttpRouterPort                      →  OrpcRouterPort
  ControllerKeyOf / ControllerPortOf  →  unchanged
  ```

  The `"UNCOVERED CONTROLLERS — …"` and `"OVERLAPPING CONTROLLERS — …"` gate
  markers are unchanged: only the `Http` prefix was the lie, "controller" was
  never one.

- e34d7a8: htmx fragments: the contract kind is deleted, routes declare themselves.

  `defineFragments`, `FragmentRoute`, `FragmentsContract` and
  `api.HtmxController(fragments, key)` are gone. A contract earns a package
  when a client consumes it — an oRPC procedure gets one because `@orpc/client`
  reads it to build a typed call. A fragment has no client: a browser navigates
  and htmx swaps the response in, so there was never a consumer for the shape
  to serve.

  `api.HtmxGet(path, options?)` and `api.HtmxPost(path, options?)` mint a route
  straight from its path, `options.requires` typed exactly as an oRPC
  procedure's mark; `HtmxPost` also takes `options.input`, the Standard Schema
  that validates the decoded form body (`GET` has no `input` field at all).
  `api.HtmxFragments([piece, …])` composes an array of them, keyed by index
  rather than a contract's key space.

  Two gaps the contract shape carried are closed by this shape rather than
  patched: an ungrantable scope on `requires` now fails the same
  `"UNGRANTABLE SCOPE"` compile-time check an oRPC contract gets, checked at
  each route's own mint instead of only at runtime (#184) — narrowly: the gate
  fires on the literal `requires` given at the mint, and a value first widened
  to `Requirements`, or a route record hand-built without the factories,
  bypasses it and falls back to the runtime walk, a `403` rather than an
  admission; and a piece minted over a marked route composed under an
  unrelated unmarked slot has no second contract instantiation left to
  construct it from, so that hole closes by construction rather than by a new
  gate (#185).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 419a9d5: CORS, body limits and response compression are options on `http()` and
  `HttpModule` rather than `plugins` lines — and every framework scalar a
  deployment could reasonably vary is now a configuration field, pinned by its
  option.

  ```ts
  export const OrderApi = HttpModule("OrderApi")({
    router: orderRouter,
    cors: { origin: "https://orders.example", credentials: true },
    bodyLimit: 5_000_000,
    compression: true,
  });
  ```

  `true` takes the underlying oRPC plugin's own defaults; a record is that
  plugin's own options type verbatim — `CORSHandlerPluginOptions`,
  `ResponseCompressionHandlerPluginOptions` — never a `Record<string, unknown>`
  bag. `plugins` stays for every oRPC plugin these three do not name.

  ## Eight new variables, each pinned by its option

  The option is what a test or a settled decision fixes; the variable is what a
  deployment sets. `Config.pinned` decides between them per field — explicit
  beats environment beats default — exactly as `PORT` and `HOST` already worked.

  | Variable                                               | Default           | Bound by                                  |
  | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | `PRE_DRAIN_DELAY_MS` / `DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS`              | `5000` / `20000`  | the kernel                                |
  | `HTTP_BODY_LIMIT`                                      | `1048576`         | `http()` — `0` is unbounded               |
  | `HTTP_CORS_ORIGIN`                                     | unset (off)       | `http()` — a comma-separated list, or `*` |
  | `HTTP_COMPRESSION`                                     | `false`           | `http()`                                  |
  | `TEMPORAL_GRACE_PERIOD_MS` / `TEMPORAL_FORCE_AFTER_MS` | `10000` / `15000` | `temporal()`                              |
  | `AMQP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`                              | `5000`            | `amqp()`                                  |

  The drain timings are the reason this shape matters: they have to agree with
  the pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, which lives in the manifest — so
  they belong beside it rather than compiled into the image. The same is true of
  a CORS origin, a body limit and Temporal's shutdown budget.

  **Every variable carries its starter's prefix** — `HTTP_`, `TEMPORAL_`, `AMQP_`,
  `STORAGE_S3_` — because several starters share one process, and a bare
  `BODY_LIMIT` is a name the next starter would also want. The exceptions are
  names the ecosystem already owns and a platform injects (`PORT`, `HOST`,
  `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `SMTP_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`), plus the kernel's own
  three, since a process has exactly one kernel.

  `@btravstack/config` gains **`Config.boolean`** for the flags: `true`/`false`,
  `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no`, `on`/`off`, case-insensitive. Anything else is an error
  rather than a falsy reading — a deployment that wrote `HTTP_COMPRESSION=enabled`
  meant to turn it on.

  Three things stay composition-time on purpose: a **shape** (`plugins`, a CORS
  record's allowed headers), because an environment carries strings; a **graph
  decision** (`instrumented`), because it changes what is built; and
  `securityHeaders`, because a deployment that can silently turn
  `x-frame-options` off is a footgun the other policies are not.

  ## Consequences
  - `HttpConfig` is `{ port, hostname, bodyLimit, corsOrigin, compression }`,
    `TemporalConfig` gains `{ gracePeriodMs, forceAfterMs }`, and `AmqpConfig`
    gains `{ connectTimeoutMs }`. Anything in the graph may read them.
  - **`AMQP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to 5 s where the library defaults to
    30**: thirty seconds is longer than most orchestrators wait before
    restarting the pod, so an unreachable broker is now reported rather than sat
    on.
  - A malformed `PROBE_PORT`, `PRE_DRAIN_DELAY_MS` or `DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` is one
    `RuntimeStartFailed` with `runtime: "kernel"` (it was `"probes"`) whose
    `ConfigInvalid` names **every** variable that was wrong — one round trip for
    the operator. A probe _bind_ failure is still `runtime: "probes"`.
  - `HttpOptions`, `TemporalTuning` and `AmqpTuning` are each spelled once and
    intersected into the module sugar's options, which now forwards the whole
    record instead of field by field. An option the sugar forgets to forward can
    no longer exist — which is what this issue was about.

  ## `bodyLimit` defaults on, and the other two default off

  An unbounded body is a trust boundary, where CORS and compression are policy a
  framework guessing is worse than one staying quiet. Over the limit is oRPC's
  `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, decided on `content-length` when one is sent and while
  streaming otherwise. `bodyLimit: false` — or `BODY_LIMIT=0` — is the previous
  unbounded behaviour.

  `compression` is the **response** half. Request decompression stays a
  `plugins` line: inflating a body before the limit measures it is a decision an
  application should make in the open.

  **CSRF stays a `plugins` line, and the claim was narrowed to say so.**
  `packages/http-server/CLAUDE.md` stated CORS, body limits, compression, CSRF,
  security headers and authentication were all "handler configuration, not a
  middleware slot" while the code shipped that for two of the six. oRPC's CSRF
  protection only bites on a request carrying a `SameSite` cookie, and this
  package configures no cookies, so it becomes an option when they arrive.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d6c035a: Health checks: a module declares one, the kernel serves them at `/healthz`.

  ```json
  {
    "status": "unhealthy",
    "components": [
      { "name": "cache", "status": "healthy" },
      {
        "name": "database",
        "status": "unhealthy",
        "reason": "connection refused"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  `@btravstack/cache`, `@btravstack/storage` and `@btravstack/prisma` each
  contribute a check. An application composing them wires nothing: one unhealthy
  component makes the whole application unhealthy, and the report names every
  component rather than stopping at the first failure.

  **`Port.many`/`Provider.member` are back in `@btravstack/di`.** They were
  removed because an audit found no consumer — true then, and false as soon as a
  second feature wanted the shape. A set port is what lets a starter DECLARE a
  check rather than register one: a registry the kernel handed out would
  type-check whether or not the call was ever made, so a starter that forgot
  would compile and report healthy forever.

  A set port nobody contributed to now resolves to `[]` rather than throwing —
  the behaviour both di reference pages already documented, and which an
  application composing no starter hits immediately.

  **`/healthz` does not gate `/readyz`.** Readiness removes a pod from its
  Service's endpoints, so failing it on a dependency several replicas share takes
  every replica out at once and turns a degraded system into an outage. The
  kernel reports; an operator decides what a `503` there means.

  `@btravstack/mailer` contributes no check: its port offers only `send`, and a
  probe that delivers mail is not a probe. A cheap `verify()` belongs to the SMTP
  adapter, and can be added there without changing this shape.

  `PrismaLike` now requires `$queryRaw` — every generated Prisma client has it,
  and the check needs the server to answer something rather than trusting a
  pooled client's idea of "connected".

- b905a31: A starter offers its OpenTelemetry instrumentation; composing `otel()` registers it.

  `@btravstack/core` declares an `Instrumentations` set port. A package
  contributes a loader, `() => Promise<unknown>`; `@btravstack/observability/otel` loads every
  contribution and hands it to the `NodeSDK`. Composing a starter **declares**
  what can be instrumented, and composing `otel()` is what turns it on — the
  Spring Boot starter shape, in one port.

  `@btravstack/prisma` is the first contributor. Engine tracing used to be
  enabled while the client was built, whether or not an SDK existed; it is now
  offered, so a graph with no `otel()` never loads `@prisma/instrumentation` at
  all.

  **This does not weaken the preload rule.** `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register`
  still has to be preloaded before the libraries it patches are imported, and no
  provider can promise that. The rule was always about instrumentations that
  patch module loading — one whose `enable()` sets a helper the library reads per
  call has no such ordering requirement, and those are what `otel()` registers.

  `load` is async and answers `undefined` rather than failing, because the
  package supplying the instrumentation is an optional peer the consumer may not
  have installed. The contributor logs the skip, since it is the one that knows
  why.

  `otel()` contributes a member of its own that loads nothing — a collector
  depending on a set port nothing provides is an unmet dependency both at plan
  time and in `Needs`, and Guice's `newSetBinder` declares the empty set for the
  same reason.

  `Tracer` leaves `@btravstack/prisma`'s instrumented `needs`. It was there for
  ordering, to get the SDK up before the instrumentation was enabled; the SDK now
  does the registering, so the ordering is inherent. `Meter` still orders the
  client after `otel()`.

- 870fee8: `Storage.presignedUpload(key, { ttlMs, contentType, contentLength })` mints a
  time-limited URL a client writes straight at the store, so an upload's bytes
  never transit the application process. The content type and the length are part
  of the signature, so the URL grants exactly one write, of exactly that size, of
  exactly that type — `contentLength` is required because it is the only ceiling a
  presigned PUT can express. The memory adapter refuses it, as it already refused
  `presignedUrl`, rather than minting a URL that would pass locally and fail in the
  deployment.

### Minor Changes

- c118a74: Raise the published Node floor to `>=22`, and use `Promise.withResolvers`.

  Node 20 reached end of life on **2026-04-30**. Every line that still receives
  security fixes — 22, 24, 26 — satisfies `>=22`, so this drops a promise rather
  than a supported runtime.

  **The old floor was never provable.** CI runs the dev toolchain, and pnpm 11
  needs `node:sqlite`, which Node 20 does not have — so no job here could ever
  execute the line `>=20` named, and `ci.yml` said so in a comment. The new floor
  sits on the same major as the matrix's `22.22` row, so the promise is exercised.

  The knock-on is `@btravstack/core`'s: `createDeferred` was an eight-line shim
  for a primitive the platform ships as `Promise.withResolvers`, held back only
  by the floor. It is gone, along with `src/deferred.ts`. `Deferred` was never
  exported, so no public surface moves — the only visible change is the
  `engines` field.

  `packages/core` raises its `lib` to `ES2024` for this, alone in the repository
  and commented where it happens; the shared `@btravstack/tsconfig` base stays on
  `ES2023` until a second package needs otherwise.

### Minor Changes

- 92a7265: A `Storage` port, an in-memory adapter, an S3-compatible adapter with
  presigned reads, and one composition function that spans, counts and logs
  every operation by default — `instrumented: false` opts out.

  A missing object is counted apart from a failure and logged at `info`, because
  asking for something that is not there is an ordinary answer and a dashboard
  that pages on it teaches its readers to ignore the fault line. `presignedUrl`
  has no not-found arm: signing asks the store nothing, so a URL for an absent
  key is minted and 404s when followed. The memory adapter refuses to presign
  rather than minting a `file://` fiction that would pass locally and fail in
  the deployment. `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` are
  the two optional peers, behind the `@btravstack/storage/s3` subpath.

### Patch Changes

- 4499df1: A comment earns its line, or it goes

  A quarter of the TypeScript in this repository was comment, and one line in ten
  an inline essay — so a reader looking for the code had to skim past the reasons
  for it. `CLAUDE.md`'s "comment density: sparse" bullet now carries a test: a
  comment earns its line only if it guards a specific line against a plausible
  "simplification", states a symbol's contract as TSDoc, is a directive with a
  reason, or is a `GIVEN`/`WHEN`/`THEN` marker.

  No API changes. What consumers see is the TSDoc these packages ship in their
  declarations: shorter, and stating each symbol's contract rather than the
  history behind it, which lives in the repository and on the documentation site.

- 31f70f7: The repository is `btravstack/btravstack`, so every package's `homepage`,
  `bugs.url` and `repository.url` points there. GitHub redirects the old slug, so
  nothing was broken — but published metadata that names a repository should name
  the one it lives in.
